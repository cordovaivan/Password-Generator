# Password-Generator Week 3 challenge

In this challenge we were given an html, css, and script file, We were to create a password generator that would meet the criteria given by the user.

When clicking the "Generate Password" button then a series of prompts should pop up and ask the user whether they would like to include certain characters in their password as well as how many characters they would like to include in the generated password.

To view this project you can follow the following link [Password-Generator](https://cordovaivan.github.io/Password-Generator/)

## Here is a list of changes made to the given Script.js File

* Created a function Generate Password
* Added variables to define the characters that would be added to the password.
* Added another set of variables with prompts that would ask the user a set of questions.
* Made variables with prompts equal to true.
* Left the Password length variable empty so that when user inserts a number in the prompt when asked it would add the value to the variable.
* Added a password variable with a value of an empty string so that when the function returns the value of the password it would return as a string.
* Created a while loop that goes through the function and as long as the criteria is met through the if statements the loop will continue to run.
* Added a return value of shuffled so it shuffles and randomizes the generated password.
